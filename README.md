# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification-using-CNN-and-Streamlit

	Developed an interactive web application for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).The project aimed to provide an easy-to-use interface for visualizing model predictions and understanding CNN behaviour.Built a CNN model to classify images into 10 different fashion categories with high accuracy.Allowed users to upload their own images for classification.Technologies Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
